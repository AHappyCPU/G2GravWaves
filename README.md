# G2GravWaves
Transient Gravitational Waves: detected by LIGO. 
As of yet undetected: Continuous Gravitational Wave signals (CWs); almost monochromatic, with their amplitude and frequency changing very slowly over years-long timescales.

Our problem: detect CWs from noisy datasets. 

NOTE: The mass quadrupoles of these sources, such as deformed neutron stars, are expected to be far smaller than those involved in compact binaries and therefore only local galactic sources are likely to produce detectable signals.

ALSO: Likely candidates for producing such signals are neutron stars spinning with some non-axisymmetric deformation (Zimmermann & Szedenits 1979). This may be a solid deformation such as mountains on the crust produced during cooling (Ushomirsky et al. 2000), from binary accretion (Gittins & Andersson 2021) or due to strong magnetic fields (Bonazzola & Gourgoulhon 1996; Cutler 2002). GW radiation can also be caused by fluid modes of oscillation beneath the crust such as r-modes (Andersson 1998; Friedman & Morsink 1998).

Useful terminology: 

Spindown: Over time, neutron stars slow, as their rotating magnetic fields in effect radiate energy associated with the rotation; older neutron stars may take several seconds for each revolution. This is called spin down. The rate at which a neutron star slows its rotation is usually constant and very small.

Periodic time (P): is the rotational period, the time for one rotation of a neutron star. 

Spin-down rate: the rate of slowing of rotation, is then given the symbol P-dot, the derivative of P with respect to time. It is defined as periodic time increase per unit time; it is a dimensionless quantity, but can be given the units of s⋅s−1 (seconds per second). Spin-down rate (P-dot) of neutron stars usually falls within the range of 10−22 to 10−9 s⋅s−1, with the shorter period (or faster rotating) observable neutron stars usually having smaller P-dot. As a neutron star ages, its rotation slows (as P increases); eventually, the rate of rotation will become too slow to power the radio-emission mechanism, and the neutron star can no longer be detected. P and P-dot allow minimum magnetic fields of neutron stars to be estimated. P and P-dot can be also used to calculate the characteristic age of a pulsar, but gives an estimate which is somewhat larger than the true age when it is applied to young pulsars.

Spindown luminosity: P and P-dot can also be combined with a neutron star's moment of inertia to estimate a quantity called spin-down luminosity, which is given the symbol (E-dot). It is not the measured luminosity, but rather the calculated loss rate of rotational energy that would manifest itself as radiation or the rate of kinetic energy loss in the slowing of its rotation giving an approximation of the pulsar’s EMR emission. For neutron stars where the spin-down luminosity is comparable to the actual luminosity, the neutron stars are said to be "rotation powered". 

Spindown Limit: The limit placed on the amplitude of gravitational waves based on the assumption that all the rotational kinetic energy lost by the star as it spins-down is through gravitational radiation. 

R-modes: Rossby waves, also known as planetary waves, are a type of inertial wave naturally occurring in rotating fluids. R-modes are unstable in any arbitrarily slowly rotating star if one assumes a perfect fluid and no magnetic field. Gravitational radiation causes this instability. The r-mode amplitude increases because the angular momentum gravity waves carry away is negative. In a perfect fluid, the r-mode amplitude becomes unbounded. In effect, neutron stars undergoing r-mode oscillations are a potentially  strong source of gravitational radiation.
